CARVE:
	Extrusion width ratio changed to absolute value in mm.
CHAMBER:
	Added options for 
setting Initial Extruder Nozzle Temperature, it is issued only at the beginning and with M109 code so printer wont try extruding if a min temp has not beeen reached.
option checkbox for turning Extruder Heater Off at Shut Down
Commented out options and function for Chamber Temperature and Holding Force as it is only confusing and I am not sure if anone uses it.
CLIP:
	Changed internal formulation to calculate the clip amount automatically based on extrusion width by using 0.5*(1/4pi).  The value still can be altered using the clip scaler which defaults to 1.
COOL:
	Added option for a minimum feedrate in case of layertime approaching 0, feedrate gets tooo low.
INSET: 
	Removed the Temperature read option. Add Custom Code for Temperature Reading
	Turn Extruder Heater Off at Shut Down is now removed and moved to Chamber
SPEED: 
	Perimeter Feedrate is entered as absolute value in mm/sec.
	The Flowrates are directly dependent on the feedrate and default to 1 (scaled up in background)
	Option to send Acceleration setting for Fill, perimeter and bridges differently.   Setting for bridges is relative to the perimeter.
	Bridge feedrateis still relative but to the Perimeter feedrate setting now.
	Flowrate for bridge is now reduced to the native flowrate of the extruder. (for explanation of the native flowrate see my blog)
